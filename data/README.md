### Data Examples

In the subdirectories, we provide examples of public data sets with prepared configuration files.

There is a readme in every subdirectory.
Most of the data sets are not directly provided due to licence reasons, however, links and descriptions on how to
download and provide the data sets are given in the respective readmes.

The commands to the binary need to be adjusted depending on your setup.
Moreover, it has to be noted that the paths in the config files are relative and depend on the location from where the
`map_matching_2` binary is called.
The config files in the example directories need to be called from the root directory of this project, i.e., the
`map_matching_2` folder containing this `data/` folder.

Feel free to try it out!
