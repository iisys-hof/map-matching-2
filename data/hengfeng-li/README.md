Ground truth dataset to download from: \
[https://web.archive.org/web/20170301001019/https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/henli/projects/map-matching/](https://web.archive.org/web/20170301001019/https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/henli/projects/map-matching/)

Place in this directory \
the `gps_track.txt` text file, \
the `groundtruth.txt` text file, \
unzip the `melbourne.osm.zip` zip file so that \
the `melbourne.osm` OSM file is in this folder, and \
unzip the `complete-osm-map.zip` zip so that \
the `complete-osm-map` folder is in this folder, which further contains \
the `edges.txt` text file, \
the `streets.txt` text file, and \
the `vertex.txt` text file.

The following commands need to be run from the base `map_matching_2`, \
the path to the `map_matching_2` executable can be adjusted as needed, e.g., \
for GCC: `run/gcc/release/bin/map_matching_2`, \
for Clang: `run/clang/release/bin/map_matching_2`, \
for MSVC: `run\msvc\release\bin\map_matching_2.exe`.

```
# prepare network
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/prepare.conf

# prepare osm network
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/prepare_osm.conf

# prepare ground truth network (not simplified!)
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/prepare_ground_truth.conf

# convert ground truth route
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/ground_truth.conf

# match tracks
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/match.conf

# match tracks on osm network
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/match_osm.conf

# compare matches with ground truth
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/compare.conf

# compare osm matches with ground truth
./map_matching_2 --conf data/hengfeng-li/conf/compare_osm.conf
```

The results will be in the `results` folder that is automatically created.

Results on our test system (accuracy is the weighted mean correct fraction in percent):
