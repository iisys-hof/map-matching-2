                                          bigger and slower, but might be 
                                          needed to improve accuracy
                                          in special cases, e.g., when 
                                          comparing the results to ground-truth
                                          that is based on the original edges
                                        "osm-aware"
                                          simplify, but don't combine roads 
                                          with different osm ids and tags,
                                          this mode is usually not recommended,
                                          except special .csv extracts are of 
                                          interest
                                          or when the map matching metrics 
                                          later down the line respect the osm 
                                          tags,
                                          which they do not by design 
                                          currently;
                                          however, use this when you export 
                                          edge_ids with the matches later,
                                          as only then the ids are correctly 
                                          preserved during simplification
                                        default is "all"
  --remove-unconnected arg (=off)       remove weakly unconnected components so
                                        that only the largest subgraph remains;
                                        when multiple isle networks are 
                                        imported, only the largest isle 
                                        remains;
                                        usually is only interesting for 
                                        removing tiny network isles in large 
                                        networks
  --remove-duplicate-nodes arg (=off)   remove duplicate nodes by comparing 
                                        exact coordinates;
                                        usually is needed if networks were 
                                        split in multiple parts with 
                                        overlapping nodes on the outer border
  --remove-duplicate-edges arg (=off)   remove duplicate edges by comparing id,
                                        geometric line, and tags;
                                        usually is needed if multiple networks 
                                        with overlapping parts are imported at 
                                        once

Memory Options:
  --memory-mapping arg (=on)            this tool uses memory-mapped files for 
                                        graph, index, and OSM import storage by
                                        default, by disabling memory-mapping, 
                                        the data can be processed completely in
                                        the main memory (RAM), in this case 
                                        binary files consisting of memory dumps
                                        of the graph and indices are used, 
                                        during the memory mapped preparation, 
                                        some files are only temporary and 
                                        discarded after;
                                        the later steps of this tool suite need
                                        to have the same memory-mode 
                                        configuration
                                        for example, non-memory-mapped graph 
                                        and indices files cannot be used in 
                                        memory-mapped mode;
                                        starting up from a memory dump is 
                                        slower than starting up from 
                                        memory-mapped files, but processing 
                                        speed is faster with in-memory 
                                        configuration compared to memory-mapped
                                        files;
                                        we recommend using memory-mapped files,
                                        especially when the underlying storage 
                                        is of SSD or NVMe type, because the 
                                        main memory usage grows very large when
                                        using in-memory configuration
  --memory-mapped-graph arg (=on)       option for disabling memory mapping for
                                        the final graph;
                                        when specified overrides global 
                                        memory-mapping configuration
  --memory-mapped-indices arg (=on)     option for disabling memory mapping for
                                        the final indices;
                                        when specified overrides global 
                                        memory-mapping configuration

                                        the final tags;
                                        when specified overrides global 
                                        memory-mapping configuration

Prepare Memory Options:
  --memory-mapped-preparation arg (=on) option for disabling memory mapping for
                                        the intermediate temporary preparation 
                                        files;
                                        the final memory mapped files needed 
                                        for the map matching software will be 
                                        created, but the intermediate temporary
                                        ones, which would automatically be 
                                        deleted after import, are not used;
                                        this drastically increases the 
                                        importing speed and drastically reduces
                                        the disk writes, also the resulting 
                                        files are the same, but a lot more main
                                        memory is needed during preparation 
                                        compared to this option disabled, so 
                                        use only wich enough main memory;

                                        usually, this mode needs to be run 
                                        first at once, since all other modes 
                                        need the resulting binary files from

                                        a typical use case is evaluating map

                                        for faster
                                        but less accurate length and angle 
                                        calculations (using haversine) than

Files Options:
  --graph-file arg (=graph.bin)         memory mapped or binary persistent 
                                        graph file
  --tags-file arg (=tags.bin)           memory mapped or binary persistent tags
                                        file
  --index-file arg (=index.bin)         memory mapped or binary persistent 
                                        index file

Memory Options:
  --memory-mapping arg (=on)            this tool uses memory-mapped files for 
                                        graph, index, and OSM import storage by
                                        default, by disabling memory-mapping, 
                                        the data can be processed completely in
                                        the main memory (RAM), in this case 
                                        binary files consisting of memory dumps
                                        of the graph and indices are used, 
                                        during the memory mapped preparation, 
                                        some files are only temporary and 
                                        discarded after;
                                        the later steps of this tool suite need
                                        to have the same memory-mode 
                                        configuration
                                        for example, non-memory-mapped graph 
                                        and indices files cannot be used in 
                                        memory-mapped mode;
                                        starting up from a memory dump is 
                                        slower than starting up from 
                                        memory-mapped files, but processing 
                                        speed is faster with in-memory 
                                        configuration compared to memory-mapped
                                        files;
                                        we recommend using memory-mapped files,
                                        especially when the underlying storage 
                                        is of SSD or NVMe type, because the 
                                        main memory usage grows very large when
                                        using in-memory configuration

                                        output columns in order for the 
                                        application results, separated by 
                                        comma;
                                          id: id of the track, aggregated in

                                          duration: matching duration in 
                                          seconds
                                          track: original track as it was 
                                          imported as WKT
                                          prepared: prepared track as WKT after
                                          track sanitation, i.e., remove 
                                          duplicates, median-merge
                                          match: map matching result as WKT
                                          track_length: track length in meter

  --export-edges arg (=off)             export matched routes based on the 
                                        complete network edges instead of the 
                                        actual parts, this is only useful if 
                                        the routes are later compared to 
                                        matches that come from a list of edge 
                                        IDs, it returns routes with parts in 
                                        the beginning and ending of the track, 
                                        and at turns, that have no equivalent 
                                        part in the track, however, the 
                                        resulting routes overlap the network 
                                        edges perfectly since they do not 
                                        start, end, and turn within the edges 
                                        at new points matching the track
  --join-merges arg (=on)               by default, the routes between 
                                        candidates are concatenated, this 
                                        parameter removes additional joint 
                                        points when possible, so all joint 
                                        points are removed except when reverse 
                                        movements within an edge happen

Tracks Options:
  --tracks arg                          path to track(s) file;
                                        can be specified multiple times for 
                                        multiple track files
  --tracks-file-type arg                track file type;
                                        by default is automatically detected 
                                        from (the first) filename extension;
                                        can be manually overridden to the 
                                        following supported file types:
                                          "csv"
                                          "gpx"
                                          "list" (only for matching)
                                          "seattle" (only for matching)
                                        the "list" and "seattle" file types are
                                        special extensions, they are meant to 
                                        be specified manually with specific 
                                        input files, and they only work in 
                                        matching mode, not in comparison mode;
                                        the "list" type awaits as input a list 
                                        of network edge IDs, it then exports 
                                        the track as WKT, based on the given 
                                        network, used for route files from Li, 
                                        Hengfeng (2014), Kubicka, M. et al.

                                        automatically resolves gaps, duplicate 
                                        node ids, and duplicate edge ids, if 
                                        there are multiple columns, use 
                                        --delimiter and --id with a number for 
                                        the edge ID column, --skip-lines is 
                                        also supported for skipping headers as 
                                        they are not needed and unsupported
                                        the "seattle" type is for exporting the
                                        ground truth route as WKT track from 
                                        the seattle dataset from Newson and 
                                        Krumm (2009), the first file is the 
                                        road network file, the second file the 
                                        ground truth file, the additional 
                                        option is because the "seattle" format 
                                        needs a special handling for the 
                                        direction

                                        which is beneficial in coordinates read
                                        mode (non-WKT mode) for faster parsing 
                                        of tracks with reduced memory 
                                        footprint; grouped means that the id 
                                        column is sorted in such a way that all
                                        rows with the same id are put together,
                                        not mixed or interrupted by rows with 
                                        different ids; in case grouped is 
                                        disabled, the whole .csv file needs to 
                                        be parsed and grouped by id before the 
                                        matching starts; this setting is 
                                        ignored in WKT read mode
  --skip-lines arg (=0)                 skip specified number of lines at the 
                                        head of the tracks .csv file, works 
                                        also in combination with no-header, 
                                        e.g., set to 1 with no-header to skip 
                                        an existing header to use number 
                                        indices for columns instead
  --no-header                           csv has no header, column 
                                        specifications are interpreted as 
                                        indices of columns
  --no-id                               csv has no id column, in this case, the
                                        id is an incrementing integer starting 
                                        from 0, see also --no-id-whole-file 
                                        setting
  --no-id-whole-file                    when active, the whole file, i.e., all 
                                        rows get the same id, when disabled 
                                        (default), the id is incremented with 
                                        each row of data; use this setting with
                                        x,y coordinate points when --no-id is 
                                        specified so that the whole file 
                                        becomes one track, i.e., combine all 
                                        points or the whole file into one track
  --id arg (=id)                        id column(s) of tracks .csv file, can 
                                        be specified multiple times for

                                        field is then used for concatenation of
                                        the values
  --id-aggregator arg (=_)              used for aggregating the values of

                                        WKT read mode can either be of type 
                                        POINT or LINESTRING, in POINT mode, 
                                        points are sorted ascending by time 
                                        column, if available, else by

                                        specified multiple times

CSV/GPX Time Options:
  --time arg (=time)                    time column(s) of tracks .csv file, is 
                                        optional if no such column exists, for 
                                        example in WKT LINESTRING read mode, 
                                        currently, the time column(s) are only 
                                        used for sorting points while reading 
                                        tracks .csv file, is ignored for .gpx 
                                        files; can be specified multiple times 
                                        similarly as --id, the time columns are
                                        first aggregated by --time--aggregator 
                                        and then parsed by the --time-format, 
                                        so the aggregator must be part of the 
                                        format, if multiple time columns exist
  --time-aggregator arg (=_)            used for aggregating the values of 
                                        composite time keys, see time
  --time-format arg (=%FT%T%Oz)         time format for parsing the time value 
                                        in the time column into unix timestamp 
                                        format, please review

  --no-parse-time                       do not parse time, for example when the
                                        time is already in unix timestamp 
                                        format (seconds), or when the time is 
                                        not parsable at all (in this case, 
                                        increments 1 per second starting from 
                                        0), or with .gpx files with invalid

                                          (i.e., for multi-line tracks)
                                          set_index: index of the candidate set
                                          candidate_index: index of the

                                          part of the resulting match

Matching Options:
  --max-time arg (=0.0)                 when max-time (defined in seconds) is 
                                        set to anything above 0.0, the matching
                                        of a track is stopped after the set 
                                        max-time is reached;there are multiple 
                                        checkpoints during the matching 
                                        algorithm for a defined aborting, this 
                                        means that it can take a slight amount 
                                        of extra time before the matching is 
                                        actually stopped, in case a matching 
                                        was stopped because the max-time was 
                                        reached, the 'aborted' column is set to
                                        'yes' in the output file, in case the 
                                        current algorithm was able to produce 
                                        any result up to this point, it is 
                                        outputted, else nothing is outputted; 
                                        for example Q-Learning might be able to
                                        output something suboptimal
  --filter-duplicates arg (=on)         filter duplicate (adjacent spatially 
                                        equal) points in tracks before 
                                        matching, is recommended
  --simplify-track arg (=on)            simplify track with Douglas-Peucker 
                                        algorithm
  --simplify-track-distance-tolerance arg (=5.0)
                                        distance tolerance in meters around 
                                        line for Douglas-Peucker algorithm
  --median-merge arg (=on)              simplify track by merging point clouds 
                                        to their median point coordinates, this
                                        reduces the amount of points when 
                                        vehicles emit positions from static 
                                        positions
  --median-merge-distance-tolerance arg (=10.0)
                                        distance tolerance in meters around a 
                                        point to merge all points within the 
                                        given radius
  --adaptive-median-merge arg (=on)     adapt median-merge-distance-tolerance 
                                        automatically for point clouds that are
                                        far from streets, the distance can be 
                                        raised up to half the distance of the 
                                        nearest road edge for merging
  --within-edge-turns arg (=off)        enables turns within edges, when 
                                        disabled, turns are only possible at 
                                        crossroads and junctions (nodes of the 
                                        graph), when enables, turns within 
                                        edges (roads of the graph) become 
                                        possible, this is done by trimming the 
                                        path from the current position to the 
                                        next node and back, by default this is 
                                        disabled, because it reduces 
                                        correctness of results with 
                                        candidate-adoption enabled as large 
                                        detours are needed for making the 
                                        optimizer collapsing candidates, it is,
                                        however, enabled by default when all 
                                        candidate-adoption features are 
                                        disabled, because then it raises the 
                                        correctness of the results as no larger
                                        detours are taken that could not be

                                          searches only the next nearest edge 
                                          (within the nearest and adjacent as 
                                          well as reversed edges),
                                          very fast but often inaccurate except

                                        radius are found, radius is starting 
                                        radius if adaptive-radius is enabled 
                                        (which is by default)
  --radius-upper-limit arg (=10000.0)   radius upper limit in meters for

                                        is used, eventually stops automatically
                                        doubling of radius when no candidates

                                        candidate search when adaptive-radius 
                                        is used, prevents too small search 
                                        radii in areas with dense track 
                                        measurements
  --adaptive-radius arg (=on)           adaptive-radius is only used when

                                        selected, the radius is then reduced to
                                        the minimum distance to the next and 
                                        previous candidate, the 
                                        radius-lower-limit is never undershot, 
                                        when no candidate is found, the radius 
                                        is doubled until radius-upper-limit, 
                                        this reduces the amount of candidates 
                                        in dense road network areas, it works 
                                        best with candidate-adoption enabled

                                        gaps in the exported track, but this is
                                        much better than high errors
  --state-size arg (=2)                 amount of adjacent track points to

                                        calculation speed because the state

                                        q-learning model is selected, epsilon 
                                        of 0.0 means no random action 
                                        selection, always choose next best, 
                                        epsilon of 1.0 means always random 
                                        selection, never select next best
  --early-stop-factor arg (=1.0)        factor for multiplication with 
                                        early-stopping counter (equals 
                                        episodes), early-stopping episodes are 
                                        calculated from sum of candidates, so 
                                        depends on candidate search settings, 
                                        early-stop-factor of 0.0 means 
                                        immediate stopping after one 
                                        improvement episode, early-stop-factor 
                                        of 1.0 means early-stop only after sum 
                                        of candidates episodes, a smaller 
                                        factor leads to faster convergence but 
                                        worse results, a larger factor (even 
                                        larger than 1.0) leads to better 
                                        results but needs more time for 
                                        convergence
  --max-episodes arg (=1000000000)      maximum episodes for definitive stop in
                                        q-learning, do not change except you 
                                        know what you are doing, training is 
                                        generally stopped early before 
                                        max-episodes is ever reached, this is 
                                        calculated from the found candidates, 
                                        the more possible candidates, the 
                                        longer the training

                                        usually, this mode needs to be run 
                                        first at once, since all other modes 
                                        need the resulting binary files from 
                                        this mode.

                                        from (the first) filename extension;
                                        can be manually overridden to the 
                                        following supported file types:
                                          "csv"
                                          "gpx"
                                          "list" (only for matching)
                                          "seattle" (only for matching)
                                        the "list" and "seattle" file types are
                                        special extensions, they are meant to 
                                        be specified manually with specific 
                                        input files, and they only work in 
                                        matching mode, not in comparison mode;
                                        the "list" type awaits as input a list 
                                        of network edge IDs, it then exports 
                                        the track as WKT, based on the given 
                                        network, used for route files from Li,

                                        automatically resolves gaps, duplicate 
                                        node ids, and duplicate edge ids, if 
                                        there are multiple columns, use 
                                        --delimiter and --id with a number for 
                                        the edge ID column, --skip-lines is 
                                        also supported for skipping headers as 
                                        they are not needed and unsupported
                                        the "seattle" type is for exporting the
                                        ground truth route as WKT track from 
                                        the seattle dataset from Newson and 
                                        Krumm (2009), the first file is the 
                                        road network file, the second file the 
                                        ground truth file, the additional 
                                        option is because the "seattle" format 
                                        needs a special handling for the 
                                        direction

                                        given srs;
                                        use EPSG code 3857 as recommendation 
                                        for cartesian WGS84 Pseudo-Mercator 
                                        projected coordinate system
  --match-transform-srs-type arg        transform srs type, can be set to 
                                        'geographic', 'spherical-equatorial', 
                                        or 'cartesian';
                                        by default automatically detects type, 
                                        see '--srs-type' for details

CSV Options:
  --match-delimiter arg (=,)            delimiter for .csv tracks file, only 
                                        for import, export always uses ',' 
                                        (because csv means 'comma' separated);
                                        for tabulator you can also use '\t', 
                                        and for space '\s', they are replaced 
                                        with the true characters before being 
                                        applied
  --match-grouped arg (=yes)            whether the .csv file is grouped by id,
                                        which is beneficial in coordinates read
                                        mode (non-WKT mode) for faster parsing 
                                        of tracks with reduced memory 
                                        footprint; grouped means that the id 
                                        column is sorted in such a way that all
                                        rows with the same id are put together,
                                        not mixed or interrupted by rows with 
                                        different ids; in case grouped is 
                                        disabled, the whole .csv file needs to 
                                        be parsed and grouped by id before the 
                                        matching starts; this setting is 
                                        ignored in WKT read mode
  --match-skip-lines arg (=0)           skip specified number of lines at the 
                                        head of the tracks .csv file, works 
                                        also in combination with no-header, 
                                        e.g., set to 1 with no-header to skip 
                                        an existing header to use number 
                                        indices for columns instead
  --match-no-header                     csv has no header, column 
                                        specifications are interpreted as 
                                        indices of columns
  --match-no-id                         csv has no id column, in this case, the
                                        id is an incrementing integer starting 
                                        from 0, see also --no-id-whole-file 
                                        setting
  --match-no-id-whole-file              when active, the whole file, i.e., all 
                                        rows get the same id, when disabled 
                                        (default), the id is incremented with 
                                        each row of data; use this setting with
                                        x,y coordinate points when --no-id is 
                                        specified so that the whole file 
                                        becomes one track, i.e., combine all 
                                        points or the whole file into one track
  --match-id arg (=id)                  id column(s) of tracks .csv file, can 
                                        be specified multiple times for 
                                        composite primary keys over multiple 
                                        columns, internally, the id-aggregator 
                                        field is then used for concatenation of
                                        the values
  --match-id-aggregator arg (=_)        used for aggregating the values of 
                                        composite primary keys, see id
  --match-wkt                           use WKT read mode for .csv tracks file 
                                        instead of default x,y coordinates read
                                        mode
  --match-x arg (=x)                    x column (or longitude) of tracks .csv 
                                        file in coordinates read mode
  --match-y arg (=y)                    y column (or latitude) of tracks .csv 
                                        file in coordinates read mode
  --match-geometry arg (=geometry)      geometry column of tracks .csv file in 
                                        WKT read mode can either be of type 
                                        POINT or LINESTRING, in POINT mode, 
                                        points are sorted ascending by time 
                                        column, if available, else by 
                                        appearance, in LINESTRING mode, 
                                        timestamp is just an incremented value 
                                        for each point
  --match-selector arg                  track selector for matching a specific 
                                        track from the tracks file, can be 
                                        specified multiple times

CSV/GPX Time Options:
  --match-time arg (=time)              time column(s) of tracks .csv file, is 
                                        optional if no such column exists, for 
                                        example in WKT LINESTRING read mode, 
                                        currently, the time column(s) are only 
                                        used for sorting points while reading 
                                        tracks .csv file, is ignored for .gpx 
                                        files; can be specified multiple times 
                                        similarly as --id, the time columns are
                                        first aggregated by --time--aggregator 
                                        and then parsed by the --time-format, 
                                        so the aggregator must be part of the 
                                        format, if multiple time columns exist
  --match-time-aggregator arg (=_)      used for aggregating the values of 
                                        composite time keys, see time
  --match-time-format arg (=%FT%T%Oz)   time format for parsing the time value 
                                        in the time column into unix timestamp 
                                        format, please review 
                                        std::chrono::parse documentation for 
                                        syntax, default reads ISO 8601 date and
                                        time with time zone
  --match-no-parse-time                 do not parse time, for example when the
                                        time is already in unix timestamp 
                                        format (seconds), or when the time is 
                                        not parsable at all (in this case, 
                                        increments 1 per second starting from 
                                        0), or with .gpx files with invalid 
                                        time attribute

Tracks Options:
  --compare-tracks arg                  path to track(s) file;
                                        can be specified multiple times for 
                                        multiple track files
  --compare-tracks-file-type arg        track file type;
                                        by default is automatically detected 
                                        from (the first) filename extension;
                                        can be manually overridden to the 
                                        following supported file types:
                                          "csv"
                                          "gpx"
                                          "list" (only for matching)
                                          "seattle" (only for matching)
                                        the "list" and "seattle" file types are
                                        special extensions, they are meant to 
                                        be specified manually with specific 
                                        input files, and they only work in 
                                        matching mode, not in comparison mode;
                                        the "list" type awaits as input a list 
                                        of network edge IDs, it then exports 
                                        the track as WKT, based on the given 
                                        network, used for route files from Li,

                                        automatically resolves gaps, duplicate 
                                        node ids, and duplicate edge ids, if 
                                        there are multiple columns, use 
                                        --delimiter and --id with a number for 
                                        the edge ID column, --skip-lines is 
                                        also supported for skipping headers as 
                                        they are not needed and unsupported
                                        the "seattle" type is for exporting the
                                        ground truth route as WKT track from 
                                        the seattle dataset from Newson and 
                                        Krumm (2009), the first file is the 
                                        road network file, the second file the 
                                        ground truth file, the additional 
                                        option is because the "seattle" format 
                                        needs a special handling for the 
                                        direction

Comparison Options:
  --compare-simplify-distance-tolerance arg (=0.1)

                                        points that have no more direction 
                                        change degrees than specified

Spatial Reference System Options:
  --compare-srs arg (=4326)             spatial reference system (srs) as EPSG 
                                        code, default is WGS84 (EPSG 4326)

                                        but less accurate length and angle 
                                        calculations (using haversine) than

Spatial Reference System Reprojection Options:
  --compare-transform-srs arg           transform spatial reference system 
                                        (srs) as EPSG code;
                                        when defined, data is transformed to 
                                        given srs;
                                        use EPSG code 3857 as recommendation 
                                        for cartesian WGS84 Pseudo-Mercator 
                                        projected coordinate system
  --compare-transform-srs-type arg      transform srs type, can be set to 
                                        'geographic', 'spherical-equatorial', 
                                        or 'cartesian';
                                        by default automatically detects type, 
                                        see '--srs-type' for details

CSV Options:
  --compare-delimiter arg (=,)          delimiter for .csv tracks file, only 
                                        for import, export always uses ',' 
                                        (because csv means 'comma' separated);
                                        for tabulator you can also use '\t', 
                                        and for space '\s', they are replaced 
                                        with the true characters before being 
                                        applied
  --compare-grouped arg (=yes)          whether the .csv file is grouped by id,
                                        which is beneficial in coordinates read
                                        mode (non-WKT mode) for faster parsing 
                                        of tracks with reduced memory 
                                        footprint; grouped means that the id 
                                        column is sorted in such a way that all
                                        rows with the same id are put together,
                                        not mixed or interrupted by rows with 
                                        different ids; in case grouped is 
                                        disabled, the whole .csv file needs to 
                                        be parsed and grouped by id before the 
                                        matching starts; this setting is 
                                        ignored in WKT read mode
  --compare-skip-lines arg (=0)         skip specified number of lines at the 
                                        head of the tracks .csv file, works 
                                        also in combination with no-header, 
                                        e.g., set to 1 with no-header to skip 
                                        an existing header to use number 
                                        indices for columns instead
  --compare-no-header                   csv has no header, column 
                                        specifications are interpreted as 
                                        indices of columns
  --compare-no-id                       csv has no id column, in this case, the
                                        id is an incrementing integer starting 
                                        from 0, see also --no-id-whole-file 
                                        setting
  --compare-no-id-whole-file            when active, the whole file, i.e., all 
                                        rows get the same id, when disabled 
                                        (default), the id is incremented with 
                                        each row of data; use this setting with
                                        x,y coordinate points when --no-id is 
                                        specified so that the whole file 
                                        becomes one track, i.e., combine all 
                                        points or the whole file into one track
  --compare-id arg (=id)                id column(s) of tracks .csv file, can 
                                        be specified multiple times for 
                                        composite primary keys over multiple 
                                        columns, internally, the id-aggregator 
                                        field is then used for concatenation of
                                        the values
  --compare-id-aggregator arg (=_)      used for aggregating the values of 
                                        composite primary keys, see id
  --compare-wkt                         use WKT read mode for .csv tracks file 
                                        instead of default x,y coordinates read
                                        mode
  --compare-x arg (=x)                  x column (or longitude) of tracks .csv 
                                        file in coordinates read mode
  --compare-y arg (=y)                  y column (or latitude) of tracks .csv 
                                        file in coordinates read mode
  --compare-geometry arg (=geometry)    geometry column of tracks .csv file in 
                                        WKT read mode can either be of type 
                                        POINT or LINESTRING, in POINT mode, 
                                        points are sorted ascending by time 
                                        column, if available, else by 
                                        appearance, in LINESTRING mode, 
                                        timestamp is just an incremented value 
                                        for each point
  --compare-selector arg                track selector for matching a specific 
                                        track from the tracks file, can be 
                                        specified multiple times

CSV/GPX Time Options:
  --compare-time arg (=time)            time column(s) of tracks .csv file, is 
                                        optional if no such column exists, for 
                                        example in WKT LINESTRING read mode, 
                                        currently, the time column(s) are only 
                                        used for sorting points while reading 
                                        tracks .csv file, is ignored for .gpx 
                                        files; can be specified multiple times 
                                        similarly as --id, the time columns are
                                        first aggregated by --time--aggregator 
                                        and then parsed by the --time-format, 
                                        so the aggregator must be part of the 
                                        format, if multiple time columns exist
  --compare-time-aggregator arg (=_)    used for aggregating the values of 
                                        composite time keys, see time
  --compare-time-format arg (=%FT%T%Oz) time format for parsing the time value 
                                        in the time column into unix timestamp 
                                        format, please review 
                                        std::chrono::parse documentation for 
                                        syntax, default reads ISO 8601 date and
                                        time with time zone
  --compare-no-parse-time               do not parse time, for example when the
                                        time is already in unix timestamp 
                                        format (seconds), or when the time is 
                                        not parsable at all (in this case, 
                                        increments 1 per second starting from 
                                        0), or with .gpx files with invalid 
                                        time attribute
